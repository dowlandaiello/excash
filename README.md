# Excash

Excash is a decentralized financial ledger written in Elixir. Excash is
amnesiac, meaning it doesn't persistently retain transaction records--it
keeps track only of current balances.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:dowlandaiello/excash.git && mix deps.get && mix escript.build && ./excash`
